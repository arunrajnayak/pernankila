                <p class="text-center text-justify justified wow fadeInDown"><b>Pernankila</b> is a  village near Hiriadka, located in the district of <b>Udupi</b> in Karnataka. This village is blessed by divine blessings and is considered to be filled with divine power. The divine abode of <b>Lord Shri Mahalingeshwara</b> and <b>Shri Mahaganapathi</b> is situated in here which is about 20 km southeast of Udupi. The Ganapathi here is called as <b><i>Udbava Ganapati</i></b> as it is believed to have come from earth by itself. People believe that he removes obstacles from one's life. </p>

                <div class="sub-section-content text-center text-justify justified wow fadeInDown">
                    <p>It is believed that in Pernankila, the Lord Mahaganapathi is a <i>Udbhava</i> deity, who is also known as <i>Swayambhoo</i> (self incarnation). The divine idol of Mahaganapathi here was said to have been found by a farmer called <b><i>Perna</i></b> while ploughing his farm. The idol of Mahaganapathi hidden under the earth accidentally got stuck to his plough. As a result, the head portion of the idol was torn apart and astonishingly blood was gushing out of it. The farmer was awe stuck on seeing this unusual scene.</p>

                    <p>Severely perturbed Perna went to his home that day and saw an unusual dream that night. In his dream, Perna was ordained to keep upside down two <i>Koppariges</i> (jar that contains hidden treasure), one at the place where he found the Mahaganapathi Idol in his farm and the other near the Shivaalaya (the Shiva temple) and visit the two spots next morning.</p>

                    <p>Perna did according to the divine order which he received in his dream. To his surprise, when he visited the spots next day, he saw the place absolutely vacant where he originally found the Mahaganapathi idol, but located the same near the Shivaalaya under the Kopparige which he had placed upside down. Later, the idol was found in a nearby well and its upper portion was only visible. From that day, the village came to be known as <b><i>Perna+Ankila</i></b> (the plough), Pernankila. It is widely believed that with the blessings of Lord Mahaganapathi, the farmer Perna's name was immortalized and the village itself came to be identified with his name and the plough, i.e., Pernankila.</p>
