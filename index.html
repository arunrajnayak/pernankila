                <p class="text-center text-justify justified wow fadeInDown"><b>Pernankila</b> is a  mid-sized village located in the district of <b>Udupi</b> in Karnataka. This village is blessed by divine blessings and is considered to be filled with divine power. The divine abode of <b>Lord Shri Mahalingeshwara</b> and <b>Shri Mahaganapathi</b> is situated in here which is about 20 km southeast of Udupi. The Ganapathi here is called <b><i>Udbava Ganapati</i></b> as it is believed to have come from earth by itself. People believe that he removes obstacles from one's life. </p>

                <h3 class="sub-section-title text-center wow fadeInDown">History</h3>
                <div class="sub-section-content text-center text-justify justified wow fadeInDown">

                    <p>It is believed that in Pernankila, the Lord Mahaganapathi is a Udbhava deity, who is also known as Swayambhoo (self incarnation). The divine idol of Mahaganapathi here was said to have been found by a farmer called <b><i>Perna</i></b> while ploughing his farm. The idol of Mahaganapathi hidden under the earth accidentally got stuck to his plough. As a result, the head portion of the idol was torn apart and astonishingly blood was gushing out of it. The farmer was awe stuck on seeing this unusual scene.</p>

                    <p>Severely perturbed Perna went to his home that day and saw an unusual dream that night. In his dream, Perna was ordained to keep upside down two Koppariges (jar that contains hidden treasure), one at the place where he found the Mahaganapathi Idol in his farm and the other near the Shivaalaya (the Shiva temple) and visit the two spots next morning.</p>

                    <p>Perna did according to the divine order which he received in his dream. To his surprise, when he visited the spots next day, he saw the place absolutely vacant where he originally found the Mahaganapathi idol, but located the same near the Shivaalaya under the Kopparige which he had placed upside down. Later, the idol was found in a nearby well and its upper portion was only visible. From that day, the village came to be known as <b><i>Perna+Ankila</i></b> (the plough), Pernankila. It is widely believed that with the blessings of Lord Mahaganapathi, the dalit farmer Perna's name was immortalized and the village itself came to be identified with his name and the plough, i.e., Pernankila.</p>

                    <p>One of the epic stories says that one <b><i>Kharasura</i></b> established Lord Mahalingeshwara here thousands of years ago. During the reign of Alupas, it is believed, a temple for Lord Mahalingeshwara was constructed here. Historians believe that the existing structure of the temple is more than a thousand year old.
                    It is learnt from a rock edict found here that one Alupa queen had constructed the Mahalingeshwara temple here. But the tragedy is that historians have not been able to read the rock edict fully till date. It was renovated 1950s. During this renovation large stones were carved by many architectures and then stones were brought near temple by elephants and then temple was built.</p>

                        Special poojas and celebrations are held during the <b><i>Ganesh Chaturthi</i></b> during which nearly 5000 devotees visit the temple and participate in the meal (<b><i>annasantarpane</i></b>) that is served on that day. Besides religious functions, cultural events are also organised on the Ganesh Chaturthi day in the temple. On the day of Ekadashi the meals are not served, the people maintain fast and offer prayers to god. During Meena in the month of March–April, on the full moon day the festivities start with the hoisting of the temple flag and Rathotsava is also organised on that day. On Tuesdays, that too if Sankashti falls on that day, the number of devotees visiting the temple increases manifold. At the end of month December bhajane's are sung and competitions are held.

                    <p>
                        It is believed that the Pernankila Shri Mahaganapati is fond of <b><i>appams</i></b> prepared out of rice, coconut, ghee and jaggery. On the Ganesh Chaturthi day nearly one quintal rice is used to prepare 50,000 appams and distribute among the devotees. Every month nearly 70,000 appams are prepared and distributed as ‘prasada’ to the devotees who visit the temple. 
                        The <b><i>kopparegeappa</i></b> is seva provided where devotees offer prayers to god and annasantharpane is made to visitors of temple.
